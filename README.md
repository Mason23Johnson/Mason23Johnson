Mason Johnson - Software Engineering Student

I am a dedicated software engineering student proficient in Java, C++, and primarily **C#**. 

Currently, I'm focused on advanced game development, leveraging my skills to create engaging 2D and 3D games using Godot. 

While I primarily code in C#, I adapt to GDScript for collaborative projects when necessary.

My expertise extends to:

C# Applications: Developing console programs and sophisticated GUI applications, as highlighted in my repositories.

2D & 3D GDScript and C# Game Development, as previously mentioned.

Java Mod Development: Creating mods for games such as Minecraft, including:

  ---Integrating Windows functionalities (e.g., webcams, microphones).
  
  ---Modifying entities, textures, sounds, and environmental assets.
  
  ---Implementing design patterns and scalable architecture.

In addition to game development, I am continuously expanding my knowledge in databases, networking, and various software technologies to broaden my professional scope.

Although my current focus lies in game design, I am passionate about exploring fields such as machine learning and cybersecurity. 

With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, I aim to deepen my understanding of AI's inner workings and the critical role of security in shaping its future.
